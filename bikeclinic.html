    <!--ABOUT-->    
    <div class="about box">
        <h1>Bike Clinic</h1>
        <p>We are proud to introduce our very own, club-community Bike Clinic. The clinic has been established by one of our regular cyclists, Osmar Hammoute at the back of his Auto Repair Shop. Come for bike maintenance & advice and some light repairs. Our clinic is run entirely by volunteers, hence the service is free of charge. Club members will only cover the cost of the parts that might need replacement. <b>Bike Clinic operates once a month</b> - on the 3rd Saturday of the month from 6pm to 8pm at the back of Osmar Repairs Shop (21 forest street).</p>

        <p class="quote-style">"I have Established the Bike Clinic as I wished to share my technical skills and knowledge with my club community. Although I am car mechanic by day, I am a bike enthusiast in my free time. It has been a pleasure to see this idea taking off and athough the workload is growing, we manage as there are always at least one or two club volunteers working with me at the clinic sessions. I was also positively surprised to see that so many kids also want to find out more about this trade and try their own hand."
