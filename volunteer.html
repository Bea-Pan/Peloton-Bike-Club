        <h3>Ride Coordinator</h3>
        <p>Take lead at the weekly meet-ups. Provide a brief of the ride route & what to expect, organise the attendants into a peloton, lead the way and plan for breaks. You can take that opportunity to work on your navigation skills. You can also take initiative to plan a new route to add to our 'favourites'.</p>

        <p class="quote-style">"I volunteered as Ride Coordinator at a Country Ride Sunday. It was a little challenging as navigation has never been my strongest side, yet with a little help of technology we made it till the end just fine! I look forward to doing it again!"</p>
