# Responsive Club Website
Codecademy Club Webpage Project
## Project Goals
The goal of this project was to build a club group page that would dynamically respond to screen resizing. 

## About
**Peloton Bike Club** is a website of a fictional club and it is not based on a real-life organisation - I came up with the idea for it for the purpose of this project. However while creating the concept & content, I was inspired by the organisational structure of the [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.com/) that I used to attend on a regular basis and which had a positive impact on my life.

In order to make the website responsive to different types of screens and change the page layout depending on the type of device (let it be a desktop, tablet or mobile phone), I used media queries. I have also used the grid and flexbox models to arrange the content 

## Objectives
* Use CSS media queries
Practice responsive web design
Git, command line, and local development
## Methods
To achieve the project goals and objectives I used grid and flexbox model.
