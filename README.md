## About :bike:
**Peloton Bike Club** is a website of a fictional club and it is not based on a real-life organisation - I came up with the idea for it for the purpose of this project. However while creating the concept & content, I was inspired by the community & volunteer organisational structure of the [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.com/) that I used to attend on a regular basis and which had a positive impact on my life.

## Methods
To achieve goals & objectives I used the follwing:
* **media queries** - I used media queries In order to make the website responsive to different types of screens and change the page layout depending on the type of device (let it be a desktop, tablet or mobile phone) 
*  **grid model** - I used grid model as a main tool for the website elements layout
*  **flexbox** - I used flexbox as a helping tool for the elements layout within their parent containers
*  **relative units** - I used relatives units such as rem, em or %  in relation to elements sizes.

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Git and GitHub
* Command terminal
